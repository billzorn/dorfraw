All files in this "raw" folder and its subfolders are released into the public domain:  to the extent permitted by law, we waive all copyright to them.  We will not pursue a copyright claim even if this waiver is not applicable in a given area.

Please consider attributing yourself or an alias if you distribute your own modifications so that they aren't confused with vanilla DF (it helps us in bug reports).

These files are distributed as part of dorfraw (https://github.com/billzorn/dorfraw). They are based on the raw/ directory distributed with the linux version of Dwarf Fortress 0.43.05 (http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), but are NOT an unmodified replica.

The goal of the "improved" branch is to remain true to the spirit of Dwarf Fortress, but to provide a better, cleaner environment for playing and modding the game. Bugs might be fixed; new bugs (or possible features) might be added. To understand the full scope of the changes, look at the commit history.

changelog:

* base raws imported from 43_05

* removed characters not in [A-Z0-9_-] from token identifiers
